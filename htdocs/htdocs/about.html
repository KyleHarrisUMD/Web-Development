        <h2>- Authenticity</h2>
        <p>Be yourself. show yourself not only

            as someone who plays hard but also as someone who

            works hard, wants a future, and cares deeply about

            something – music, the environment, animal welfare,

            tennis, helping people, chess or knitting – whatever

            it is. self-esteem arises from reminding yourself of

            what you do well and the good things you work for.</p>

    <div class="gird_div">
        <h2>- Diversity</h2>
        <p>We are all different and many ways exist

            for being talented. scientist have identified 9 different

            forms of intelligence. (see _____). we all have a seat

            at the smart table. value what you do well and pursue

            it even if you do not want to be a lawyer or hedge fund

            manager or any supposedly high income job you likely

            will come to hate.</p>

    <div class="gird_div">
        <h2>- Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our goal is to empower people and make

            dreams possible and attainable. we need to make

            money to stay in business but we promise not to treat

            you as an income stream based on what you say about

            yourself. we will link you with resources connected

            to your passions and goals and we want those links to

            be helpful. it will be your decision if you want to be

            connected in that way.</p>

    <div class="gird_div">
        <h2>- Tricky Times</h2>
        <p>Recent events have

            conspired to make getting ahead very difficult: the

            economic meltdown of the past 7 years, crushing

            student loan debt laws that can cripple for life,

            employers who expect unpaid internships as a way

            to get a foothold in the job market, to name a few.

            we think these facts of life make life difficult and

            achieving goals seem like a steep climb. we believe

            highlighting your talents and accomplishments are

            more likely to move you forward than liking pictures

            of kittens posted online or connecting with people

            who think beyonce’s latest cd is awesome.

        <p>Connecting with people who share

            your passions and interests. advancing a future for you

            that you want by branding yourself and putting yourself in

            the best bright light for whatever you want for yourself

            and to achieve your goals. linking you to people who will

            help you develop the skills you need and give advice and
